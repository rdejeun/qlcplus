                            ===================

                        
Eurolite® freeDMX AP interface receives the 512-channel values from the client
software through a Wi-Fi network and transmits them to the DMX line via the DMX
OUT cable.

The easiest way to control the DMX fixtures is to use the AP mode (Access Point)
which provides a dedicated WLAN with a DHCP service where the client can connect
without requiring any existing Wi-Fi network.

The factory default settings for the AP mode are:
 - WiFi standard      = IEEE 802.11g/b/n
 - Frequency range    = 2.4 GHz range (ISM), 11 channels
 - Network SSID       = freeDMX_AP_xxxxxx
 - IP address         = 192.168.4.1
 - UDP port           = 10100

1) Connection initialisation
----------------------------

To start the connection with the freeDMX interface, the client sends the
following 4-byte UDP message:

  Client >> [UDP] E5 39 60 00 (4 bytes) >> freeDMX

The freeDMX interface sends back a reply:
  
  freeDMX >> [UDP] A7 (1 byte) >> Client
  freeDMX >> [UDP] AA (1 byte) >> Client

  
From this moment and for all the time the connection is established, the
freeDMX interface sends an acknowledge word to the client every second:

  freeDMX >> [UDP] F0 64 (2 bytes) >> Client

If the acknowledgement is not received on time, the client should consider
the connection has been broken.


2) Connection established
-------------------------

Every 40 ms, the client has to send a block of 7 UDP frames of 250 bytes with
the values (xx) for each of the 512 DMX channels:

  1: [UDP] C0 00 xx  C0 01 xx  C0 02 xx ... 51 xx  C0 52 xx  C0 (250 bytes)
  2: [UDP] 53 xx  C0 54 xx  ...  C0 7F xx  C2 00 xx  ...  C2 26 (250 bytes)
  3: [UDP] xx   C2 27 xx   C2 28 xx   C2 29 xx  ...    C2 79 xx (250 bytes)
  4: [UDP] C2 7A xx  ...  C2 7F xx  C4 00 xx  ...  C4 4C xx  C4 (250 bytes)
  5: [UDP] 4D xx  C4 4E xx  ...   C4 7F xx  C6 00 xx ...  C6 20 (250 bytes)
  6: [UDP] xx  C6 21 xx  C6 22 xx  C6 23 xx ... 72 xx  C6 73 xx (250 bytes)
  7: [UDP] 74 xx  ... C6 7E xx 86 7F xx (36 bytes)

DMX channels from 001 to 128 are coded by words from C0 00 to C0 7F.
DMX channels from 129 to 256 are coded by words from C2 00 to C2 7F.
DMX channels from 257 to 384 are coded by words from C4 00 to C4 7F.
DMX channels from 384 to 511 are coded by words from C6 00 to C6 7E.
Last DMX channel (512) is coded by word 86 7F instead of C6 7F.

The freeDMX interface sometimes sends a reply [frequency not understood yet]:
  
  freeDMX >> [UDP] AA (1 byte) >> Client
  
  
3) Connection termination
-------------------------

When the client has to terminate the connection, it sends a 2-byte frame to
the interface:

  Client >> [UDP] AC 00 (2 bytes) >> freeDMX
  
This termination word can be sent even if the bunch of 7 frames is not
completely transmitted.


4) Plugin configuration
-----------------------

The configuration of the plugin should allow to configure one or more freeDMX
interfaces (lines in a table).

For each freeDMX interface, the following information should be specified:
  - universe number,
  - host network adapter (defined by its IP address, default=192.168.4.100),
  - freeDMX IP address (default=192.168.4.1),
  - UPD port (default=10100).
